(a) For purposes of this section:

""Licensed firearm dealer"" means any person licensed as a deadly weapons dealer pursuant to Chapter 9 of Title 24 and

18 U.S.C. § 921 et seq.

(b) As a condition of its license, any dealer holding a license pursuant to this chapter shall facilitate the transfer of a

firearm, as that term is defined in § 222 of Title 11, from any person who is not so licensed, upon the request of said

unlicensed seller pursuant to the following procedure:

(1) The prospective buyer and seller shall jointly appear at the place of business of the dealer, during said dealer's

regular hours of business, and shall inform the dealer of their desire to avail themselves of the advantages of the

procedure set forth herein.

(2) The dealer shall then subject the prospective buyer to a criminal history record check pursuant to the terms of

§ 1448A of Title 11.

(3) In the event that said record check reveals that the prospective buyer is prohibited from possessing,

purchasing or owning a firearm pursuant to § 1448 of Title 11, the dealer shall so inform both parties of that fact and the

transfer shall not take place.

(4) Any dealer who is asked to facilitate the transfer of a firearm pursuant to the terms of this section, may charge

a reasonable fee for said service, said fee not to exceed $20 per criminal history check performed pursuant to this

procedure.

(5) Failure or refusal on the part of the dealer to facilitate the transfer of a firearm pursuant to the procedures set

forth herein shall be adequate cause to suspend the license of said dealer for a period not to exceed 30 days per

occurrence.",0.9697499239796536,0.0,0.5939822199347523,0.0094056829901921,0.0,0.0,1.1999605531278483,0.0,0.0,0.475175528176367,0.0404133884982483,0.131669569261475,0.2656837377737086,0.031922175241094,0.2479755225540463,0.006257817358736,0.3655414930050403,0.8832566566620398,0.0640237854564005,0.1310635511564981,-1.7148538833896498

Common law castle doctrine was solidified in the United States throughout the 19th century.  “By the beginning of the twentieth century it was well accepted in the United States that a man attacked in his own home had no duty to retreat before using deadly force, so long as he reasonably believed it necessary to save his own life.” Indeed, by the 1920s, sources note that the castle doctrine expanded to cover situations where the individual had a reasonable fear of imminent death or severe bodily harm.

The petition shall also describe the type and location of any firearm or firearms presently believed by the petitioner to be possessed or controlled by the respondent. 

(b) If the respondent is alleged to pose an immediate and present danger of causing personal injury to an intimate partner, or an intimate partner is alleged to have been the target of a threat or act of violence by the respondent, petitioner shall make a good faith effort to provide notice to any and all intimate partners of the respondent. The notice must include that the petitioner intends to petition the court for an emergency firearms restraining order, and, if petitioner is a law enforcement officer, referral to relevant domestic violence or stalking advocacy or counseling resources, if appropriate.

(a) Beginning 180 days after the effective date of this Act, it is unlawful for a person or entity to engage in the business of selling, leasing, or otherwise transferring firearms without a valid certificate of license issued under this Act. In the event that a person or entity maintains multiple licenses to engage in different lines of business requiring different licenses at one location, then the licenses shall be deemed one license for purposes of certification. In the event that a person or entity maintains multiple licenses to engage in business at multiple locations, under the same business name on the license or a different business name on the license, then each license and location must receive its own certification.

(b) It is unlawful for a person or entity without first being a certified licensee under this Act to act as if he or she is certified under this Act, to advertise, to assume to act as a certified licensee or to use a title implying that the person or entity is engaged in business as a certified licensee without a license certified under this Act.

(c) It is unlawful to obtain or attempt to obtain any certificate of license under this Act by material misstatement or fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5-85, in addition to any penalty imposed under this Section, any certificate of license obtained under this Act due to material misstatement or fraudulent misrepresentation shall automatically be revoked.

(d) A person who violates any provision of this Section is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first violation, and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent violation.

(e) In addition to any other penalty provided by law, any person or entity who violates any provision of this Section shall pay a civil penalty to the Department in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each offense, as determined by the Department. The civil penalty shall be assessed by the Department after a hearing is held in accordance with Sections 5-95 and 5-100.

(f) The Department has the authority and power to investigate any and all unlicensed activity requiring a license certified under this Act.

(g) The civil penalty shall be paid within 90 days after the effective date of the order imposing the civil penalty. The order shall constitute a judgment and may be filed and execution had thereon in the same manner as any judgment from any court of record.

(h) In the event the certification of a certified licensee is revoked, it shall be a violation of this Act for the revoked licensee to seek certification of a license held under a different business name, or to re-open as a certified licensee under another business name using the same license or as the same person or entity doing business under a different business name.

(i) The Department shall require all of the following information from each applicant for certification under this Act:

(1) The name, full business address, and telephone number of the entity. The business address for the entity shall be the complete street address where firearms in the inventory of the entity are regularly stored, shall be located within the State, and may not be a Post Office Box.

This clause shall not apply to any make and model of firearm for which a sample of three firearms in new condition all pass the following test: Each of the three samples shall fire 600 rounds, stopping every 100 rounds to tighten any loose screws and to clean the gun if required by the cleaning schedule in the user manual, and as needed to refill the empty magazine or cylinder to capacity before continuing. For any firearm that is loaded in a manner other than via a detachable magazine, the tester shall also pause every 50 rounds for ten minutes. The ammunition used shall be the type recommended by the firearm manufacturer in its user manual or, if none is recommended, any standard ammunition of the correct caliber in new condition. A firearm shall pass this test if it fires the first 20 rounds without a malfunction, fires the full 600 rounds with not more than six malfunctions and completes the test without any crack or breakage of an operating part of the firearm. The term “crack” or “breakage” shall not include a crack or breakage that does not increase the danger of injury to the user. For purposes of evaluating the results of this test, malfunction shall mean any failure to feed, chamber, fire, extract or eject a round or any failure to accept or eject a magazine or any other failure which prevents the firearm, without manual intervention beyond that needed for routine firing and periodic reloading, from firing the chambered round or moving a new round into position so that the firearm is capable of firing the new round properly. “Malfunction” shall not include a misfire caused by a faulty cartridge the primer of which fails to detonate when properly struck by the firearm's firing mechanism. Nineteenth, That no licensee shall sell, rent, lease, transfer or deliver or offer for sale, lease, transfer or delivery any firearm to any purchaser in the commonwealth unless such sale is to a business entity that is primarily a firearms wholesaler, and the sale, by its terms, prohibits such purchaser from reselling such firearm to a firearm retailer or consumer in the commonwealth if such firearm is prone to accidental discharge which, for purposes of this clause, shall mean any make and model of firearm for which a sample of five firearms in new condition all undergo, and none discharge during, the following test: Each of the five sample firearms shall be: (a) test loaded; (b) set so that the firearm is in a condition such that pulling the trigger and taking any action that must simultaneously accompany the pulling of the trigger as part of the firing procedure would fire the handgun; and (c) dropped onto a solid slab of concrete from a height of one meter from each of the following positions: (i) normal firing position; (ii) upside down; (iii) on grip; (iv) on the muzzle; (v) on either side; and (vi) on the exposed hammer or striker or, if there is no exposed hammer or striker, the rearmost part of the firearm. If the firearm is designed so that its hammer or striker may be set in other positions, each sample firearm shall be tested as above with the hammer or striker in each such position but otherwise in such condition that pulling the trigger, and taking any action that must simultaneously accompany the pulling of the trigger as part of the firing procedure, would fire the firearm. Alternatively, the tester may use additional sample firearms of the same make and model, in a similar condition, for the test of each of these hammer striker settings. Twentieth, That no licensee shall sell, rent, lease, transfer or deliver or offer for sale, lease, transfer or delivery, any firearm to any purchaser in the commonwealth unless such sale is to a business entity that is primarily a firearm wholesaler, and the sale, by its terms, prohibits the purchaser from reselling such firearm to a firearm retailer or consumer in the commonwealth if such firearm is prone to: (i) firing more than once per pull of the trigger; or (ii) explosion during firing.",0.0,0.3372243418473412,0.0,0.7313571890621959,0.1851583466847132,0.4004038354823935,0.0803288946585285,0.2049130712605883,0.3384974374217246,1.1974837293721066,0.0,0.1975248874426504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0314845384489338,0.1554036339698262,0.4594274720807672,0.1689933147555923,0.1324666909637715,-0.2370005926950673

I. Upon a showing of an immediate and present danger of abuse, the court may enter temporary orders to protect the plaintiff with or without actual notice to defendant. The court may issue such temporary orders by telephone or facsimile. Such telephonically issued orders shall be made by a circuit court judge to a law enforcement officer, shall be valid in any jurisdiction in the state, and shall be effective until the close of the next regular court business day. Such orders shall be returnable to the circuit court where the plaintiff resides or to which the plaintiff has fled, unless otherwise ordered by the issuing judge. If non-telephonic temporary orders are made ex parte, the party against whom such relief is issued may file a written request with the clerk of the court and request a hearing on such orders. Such hearing shall be held no less than 3 business days and no more than 5 business days after the request is received by the clerk. Such hearings may constitute the final hearing described in RSA 173-B:3, VII. Such temporary relief may direct the defendant to relinquish to a peace officer any and all firearms and ammunition in the control, ownership, or possession of the defendant, or any other person on behalf of the defendant for the duration of the protective order. Other temporary relief may include: 

(a) Protective orders: 

(1) Restraining the defendant from abusing the plaintiff. 

(2) Restraining the defendant from entering the premises and curtilage where the plaintiff resides, except when the defendant is accompanied by a peace officer and, upon reasonable notice to the plaintiff, is allowed entry by the plaintiff for the sole purpose of retrieving toiletries, medication, clothing, business equipment, and any other items as determined by the court. 

II. The defendant may be prohibited from purchasing, receiving, or possessing any deadly weapons and any and all firearms and ammunition for the duration of the order. The court may subsequently issue a search warrant authorizing the peace officer to seize any deadly weapons specified in the protective order and any and all firearms and ammunition, if there is probable cause to believe such firearms and ammunition and specified deadly weapons are kept on the premises or curtilage of the defendant and if the court has reason to believe that all such firearms and ammunition and specified deadly weapons have not been relinquished by the defendant.“Intimate partner” means a person with whom the actor is currently or was formerly involved in a romantic relationship, regardless of whether or not the relationship was sexually consummated.

For that purpose, the records of the appropriate office of the department of mental hygiene concerning previous or present mental illness of the applicant shall be available for inspection by the investigating officer of the police authority. In order to ascertain any previous criminal record, the investigating officer shall take the fingerprints and physical descriptive data in quadruplicate of each individual by whom the application is signed and verified. Two copies of such fingerprints shall be taken on standard fingerprint cards eight inches square, and one copy may be taken on a card supplied for that purpose by the federal bureau of investigation; provided, however, that in the case of a corporate applicant that has already been issued a dealer in firearms license and seeks to operate a firearm dealership at a second or subsequent location, the original fingerprints on file may be used to ascertain any criminal record in the second or subsequent application unless any of the corporate officers have changed since the prior application, in which case the new corporate officer shall comply with procedures governing an initial application for such license. When completed, one standard card shall be forwarded to and retained by the division of criminal justice services in the executive department, at Albany. A search of the files of such division and written notification of the results of the search to the investigating officer shall be made without unnecessary delay. Thereafter, such division shall notify the licensing officer and the executive department, division of state police, Albany, of any criminal record of the applicant filed therein subsequent to the search of its files.

Currentness

(A) Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of another, or defense of the accused's residence presented as described in division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.

(B)(1) A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's residence. If, at the trial of a person who is accused of an offense that involved the person's use of force against another, there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's residence, as the case may be.

(2) Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the person using the defensive force.

(3) The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does not apply if either of the following is true:

(a) The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.

(b) The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be, in that residence or vehicle.

(4) The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence, provided that the prosecution's burden of proof remains proof beyond a reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.

(C) As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” contained in division (E) of this section.

(D) As used in this section:

(1) An “affirmative defense” is either of the following:

(a) A defense expressly designated as affirmative;

(b) A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.

(2) “Dwelling” means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a building or conveyance includes, but is not limited to, an attached porch, and a building or conveyance with a roof over it includes, but is not limited to, a tent.

(3) “Residence” means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as a guest.

(4) “Vehicle” means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that is designed to transport people or property.

(E) “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reason and common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in the most important of the person's own affairs.",0.0,0.3660470609469531,0.0683004309247989,0.6991703077367102,0.1720816223259152,0.3653569674853069,0.0,0.1281268986856285,0.4225846901461659,1.2974994188006437,0.0,0.0530539273790276,0.0,0.0,0.2064309469751156,0.0,0.1965092940840611,0.2538025096552144,0.2045418266972533,0.1654490773067688,0.1721094373142848
